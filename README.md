# Notch Shopping List

You might think 'oh another shopping list app' but actually no!  
I am developing this app because i need organized shopping list but,  
i don't need extra unnecessary features and ads on my shopping list app.

Who needs to sign-in to check what's missing on their fridge; i, sure don't.
